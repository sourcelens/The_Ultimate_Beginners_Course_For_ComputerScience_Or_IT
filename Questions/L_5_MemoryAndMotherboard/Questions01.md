2 : When we power down the system the data inside the RAM _______

a) is retained  
b) is changed  
c) is lost  
d) is unchanged


**Answer** c)


**Description**

a) The primary memory or RAM requires power to work.So if the power is switched off, all the data in the computer memory is lost .But disk does not require power to retain data inside it. So Option (a) is retained is incorrect.

b) The primary memory or RAM requires power to work.So if the power is switched off, all the data in the computer memory is lost .But disk does not require power to retain data inside it. So Option (a) is retained is incorrect.

c) The primary memory or RAM requires power to work.So if the power is switched off, all the data in the computer memory is lost .But disk does not require power to retain data inside it. So Option (a) is retained is incorrect.

d) The primary memory or RAM requires power to work.So if the power is switched off, all the data in the computer memory is lost .But disk does not require power to retain data inside it. So Option (a) is retained is incorrect.

3 : Types of Disks available in modern times is/are

a) SSD  
b) USB  
c) HDD  
d) Both a & c


**Answer** d)


**Description**

a) SSD is Solid State Disk which is small & chip like similar to CPU.HDD is Hard Disk Drive which has a rotating disk inside it. These two are the secondary storage devices available today.USB are devices connected to the computer through a set of wires called Bus, not a disk, although USB disks are available they fall into either SSD or HDD category.
