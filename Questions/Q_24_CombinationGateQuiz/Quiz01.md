What will be the binary output at C, if A and B is equal to 0?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 0 or 1  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**

a) If A = 0, C will be 1 because it is the output of a NOT gate.

b) If A = 0, C will be 1 because it is the output of a NOT gate.

c) If A = 0, C will be 1 because it is the output of a NOT gate.

d) If A = 0, C will be 1 because it is the output of a NOT gate.

What will be the binary output at Y, if C and D is equal to 1?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 0 or 1  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a)  

**Description**

a) If C and D is equal to 1, Y will be 0, because it is the output of a NOR gate.

b) If C and D is equal to 1, Y will be 0, because it is the output of a NOR gate.

c) If C and D is equal to 1, Y will be 0, because it is the output of a NOR gate.

d) If C and D is equal to 1, Y will be 0, because it is the output of a NOR gate.
