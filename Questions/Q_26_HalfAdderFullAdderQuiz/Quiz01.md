a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 0 or 1  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a)

**Description**

a) If C = 1 and D = 0, the Output at F will be 0, as it is the output of AND gate.

b) If C = 1 and D = 0, the Output at F will be 0, as it is the output of AND gate.

c) If C = 1 and D = 0, the Output at F will be 0, as it is the output of AND gate.

d) If C = 1 and D = 0, the Output at F will be 0, as it is the output of AND gate.
