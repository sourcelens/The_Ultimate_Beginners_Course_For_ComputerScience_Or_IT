What will be the Output O of this Half adder, if A and B is equal to 0?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 0 or 1  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a)

**Description**

a) If A and B is equal to 0, the Output O will be Zero, as it is the output of XOR gate. When both inputs are same for XOR gate, output will be 0.

b) If A and B is equal to 0, the Output O will be Zero, as it is the output of XOR gate. When both inputs are same for XOR gate, output will be 0.

c) If A and B is equal to 0, the Output O will be Zero, as it is the output of XOR gate. When both inputs are same for XOR gate, output will be 0.

d) If A and B is equal to 0, the Output O will be Zero, as it is the output of XOR gate. When both inputs are same for XOR gate, output will be 0.

What will be the Output O of this Half adder, if A = 1 and B = 0?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 0 or 1  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b)

**Description**

a) If A = 1 and B = 0, the Output O will be 1 as it is the output of XOR gate. When the input values are different for XOR gate, output will be 1.

b) If A = 1 and B = 0, the Output O will be 1 as it is the output of XOR gate. When the input values are different for XOR gate, output will be 1.

c) If A = 1 and B = 0, the Output O will be 1 as it is the output of XOR gate. When the input values are different for XOR gate, output will be 1.

d) If A = 1 and B = 0, the Output O will be 1 as it is the output of XOR gate. When the input values are different for XOR gate, output will be 1.
