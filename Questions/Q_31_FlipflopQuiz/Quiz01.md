What will be the output of this Flipflop Q, when S = 0 and R = 1 and assuming Q’ = 0?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 1 or 0  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

When S = 0 and R =1 and assume Q’ = 0, both the inputs of First NAND gate will be 0. So the output Q will be 1, as it is the output of a NAND gate.

What will be the output of this Flipflop Q, when S = 1 and R = 1?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 1 or 0  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** c) 

**Description**

When S = 1 and R =1 the output of the circuit will retain the previous output which is considered as memory. So if Q was 1 will be retaining 1 and if Q (previous output) is 0 it will retain 0.

What will be the output of this Flipflop Q, when S = 1 and R = 0 and assuming Q’ = 1?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 1 or 0  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

When S = 1 and R =0 and assume Q’ = 1, the inputs of First NAND gate will be both 1. So the output Q will be 0, as it is the output of a NAND gate.

What will be the output of this Flipflop Q, when S = 0 and R = 0?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 1 or 0  
d) Invalid condition  

**Answer** d) 

**Description**

When S = 0 and R =0 and assume Q’ = 1, the inputs of First NAND gate will be 1 and 0. So the output Q will be 1, as it is the output of a NAND gate. As both Q and Q’ is 1 it is an invalid condition.
