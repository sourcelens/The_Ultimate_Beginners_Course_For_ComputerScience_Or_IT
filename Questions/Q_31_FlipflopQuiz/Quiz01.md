What will be the output of this Flipflop Q, when S = 0 and R = 1 and assuming Q’ = 0?  

a) 0  
b) 1  
c) Either 1 or 0  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

a) When S = 0 and R =1 and assume Q’ = 0, both the inputs of First NAND gate will be 0. So the output Q will be 1, as it is the output of a NAND gate. 

b) When S = 0 and R =1 and assume Q’ = 0, both the inputs of First NAND gate will be 0. So the output Q will be 1, as it is the output of a NAND gate. 

c) When S = 0 and R =1 and assume Q’ = 0, both the inputs of First NAND gate will be 0. So the output Q will be 1, as it is the output of a NAND gate. 

d) When S = 0 and R =1 and assume Q’ = 0, both the inputs of First NAND gate will be 0. So the output Q will be 1, as it is the output of a NAND gate.
