2 : Northbridge connects CPU and _______

a) Keyboard  
b) Mouse  
c) Graphics card  
d) All of the above


**Answer** c)

**Description**

The bus controller, Northbridge also connects CPU & Graphics card. Normally due to performance reasons Graphics card is connected to Northbridge via PCI Express bus. Options (a) & (b) are connected to CPU through a bus controller called Southbridge.

3 : CPU & Memory are connected via Northbridge through a bus called_______

a) FSB  
b) IB  
c) Southbridge  
d) None of the above 


**Answer** a)

**Description**

CPU & Memory are connected to each other through a bus called FSB or Front Side Bus via Northbridge bus controller. FSB is a very fast bus as the data transfer between CPU & Memory must be very fast. Option (b) IB is Internal Bridge which connects the bus controllers called Northbridge & Southbridge. Option (c) Southbridge is a bus controller that connects other devices like Keyboard, Mouse, Disk etc. to CPU.

4 : Northbridge & Southbridge are connected to each other via_______

a) FSB  
b) IB  
c) Disk  
d) All of the above


**Answer** b)

**Description**

The bus controllers Northbridge & Southbridge are connected to each other through a bus called IB or Internal Bus. Northbridge & Southbridge are nothing but chips. Now in modern CPU they are inside the CPU. During early 90s, they are inside motherboard & outside CPU. But due to performance reasons that become very fast the Northbridge & Southbridge are incorporated inside the CPU. Option (a) FSB is Front Side Bus which connects CPU & Memory. Option (b) Disk is a secondary storage device.
