1 : Which instruction/instructions below have AT LEAST one Implicit arguments?  

a) MOV  
b) RET  
c) ADD  
d) SUB  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**  

a) RET uses stack memory ( stack pointer ) to check which address to return. (RET can have also explicit arg which is out of scope our discussion ) Implicit argument means that we don’t pass anything, they operate on arguments, some from memory some from registers.

b) RET uses stack memory ( stack pointer ) to check which address to return. (RET can have also explicit arg which is out of scope our discussion ) Implicit argument means that we don’t pass anything, they operate on arguments, some from memory some from registers.

c) RET uses stack memory ( stack pointer ) to check which address to return. (RET can have also explicit arg which is out of scope our discussion ) Implicit argument means that we don’t pass anything, they operate on arguments, some from memory some from registers.
