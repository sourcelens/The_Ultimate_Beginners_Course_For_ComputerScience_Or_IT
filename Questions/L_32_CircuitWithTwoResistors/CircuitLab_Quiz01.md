What will be the voltage at the point marked red in the above circuit?

a) 1V  
b) 0V  
c) 5V  
d) 10V  


**Answer** c)


**Description**

a) Here we are giving a voltage of 5V to the circuit with the battery. So at the point marked the voltage will be 5V which we gave using the battery.

b) Here we are giving a voltage of 5V to the circuit with the battery. So at the point marked the voltage will be 5V which we gave using the battery.

c) Here we are giving a voltage of 5V to the circuit with the battery. So at the point marked the voltage will be 5V which we gave using the battery.

d) Here we are giving a voltage of 5V to the circuit with the battery. So at the point marked the voltage will be 5V which we gave using the battery.

What will be the voltage at the point marked red in the above circuit?  

a) 1V  
b) 0V  
c) 2.5V  
d) 5V  


**Answer** c)


**Description**

a) Here the voltage will be evenly spread across the two resistors. So in between the two resistors the voltage will be exactly the half which we are given at the beginning which will be the half of 5V and will be 2.5V. 

b) Here the voltage will be evenly spread across the two resistors. So in between the two resistors the voltage will be exactly the half which we are given at the beginning which will be the half of 5V and will be 2.5V.
