**Answer** c)


**Description**

a) The total voltage 5V is spread across the two resistors. So the voltage at the middle of the two resistors, which is the marked point, will be one third of the 5V, because it will be the voltage that is spread across R2 resistor. Higher the value of the resistor higher the drop across it. Option b) is incorrect as it is the voltage drop across the resistor R1.
