a) 0V  
b) 5V  
c) 1V  
d) 100V  


**Answer** b)


**Description**

a) Here the diode shown is forward biased or the diode is on, so its resistance will be theoretically equal to zero. So the voltage at the marked point, which is between the diode and resistor, will be 5V, as the whole voltage is spread across the R1 resistor.

a) 10V  
b) 5V  
c) 1V  
d) 0V  


**Answer** b)


**Description**

a) Here as the transistor is connected to the ground, the voltage given to it is 0V. So it is off or reverse biased and therefore the resistance of the transistor will be infinity or very high. Therefore the entire voltage will be spread across the transistor and the voltage at the measured point will be 5V and the resistance of the R1 resistor will be immaterial.

b) Here as the transistor is connected to the ground, the voltage given to it is 0V. So it is off or reverse biased and therefore the resistance of the transistor will be infinity or very high. Therefore the entire voltage will be spread across the transistor and the voltage at the measured point will be 5V and the resistance of the R1 resistor will be immaterial.

c) Here as the transistor is connected to the ground, the voltage given to it is 0V. So it is off or reverse biased and therefore the resistance of the transistor will be infinity or very high. Therefore the entire voltage will be spread across the transistor and the voltage at the measured point will be 5V and the resistance of the R1 resistor will be immaterial.
