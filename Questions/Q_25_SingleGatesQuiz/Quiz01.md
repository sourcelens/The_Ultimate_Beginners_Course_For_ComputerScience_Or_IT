What will be the output voltage of the above AND gate?  

a) 0V  
b) 5V  
c) Either 0V or 5V  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a)

**Description**

a) Here as both the input voltages are connected to the ground (0V) the output of AND gate will be 0V (Binary output will be 0).

b) Here as both the input voltages are connected to the ground (0V) the output of AND gate will be 0V (Binary output will be 0).

c) Here as both the input voltages are connected to the ground (0V) the output of AND gate will be 0V (Binary output will be 0).

d) Here as both the input voltages are connected to the ground (0V) the output of AND gate will be 0V (Binary output will be 0).
