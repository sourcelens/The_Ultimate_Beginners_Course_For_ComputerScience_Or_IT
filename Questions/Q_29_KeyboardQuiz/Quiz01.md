What will be the binary output, when we press 1 on the keyboard?  

a) 1 0 0 0  
b) 0 0 0 1  
c) 0 1 0 0  
d) 0 1 0 0  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

a) As we press 1, J will become 1 because it is the output of an OR gate. The red wire giving input to the OR gate is 1 that’s why J is becoming 1. If J is 1, N will be 1, as it is the output of an OR gate. K, L and M will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 0 0 1, which is the binary equivalent of 1.

b) As we press 1, J will become 1 because it is the output of an OR gate. The red wire giving input to the OR gate is 1 that’s why J is becoming 1. If J is 1, N will be 1, as it is the output of an OR gate. K, L and M will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 0 0 1, which is the binary equivalent of 1.

c) As we press 1, J will become 1 because it is the output of an OR gate. The red wire giving input to the OR gate is 1 that’s why J is becoming 1. If J is 1, N will be 1, as it is the output of an OR gate. K, L and M will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 0 0 1, which is the binary equivalent of 1.
