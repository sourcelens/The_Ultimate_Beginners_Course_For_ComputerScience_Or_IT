What will be the binary output, when we press 1 on the keyboard?  

a) 1 0 0 0  
b) 0 0 0 1  
c) 0 1 0 0  
d) 0 1 0 0  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

As we press 1, J will become 1 because it is the output of an OR gate. The red wire giving input to the OR gate is 1 that’s why J is becoming 1. If J is 1, N will be 1, as it is the output of an OR gate. K, L and M will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 0 0 1, which is the binary equivalent of 1.

What will be the binary output, when we press 2 on the keyboard?  

a) 0 1 0 0  
b) 1 0 0 0  
c) 0 0 1 0  
d) 0 0 0 1  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

As we press 2, F will become 1 because it is the output of an OR gate. The yellow wire giving input to the OR gate is 1 that’s why F is becoming 1. If F is 1, M will be 1, as it is the output of an OR gate. K, L and N will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 0 1 0, which is the binary equivalent of 2.

What will be the binary output, when we press 3 on the keyboard?  

a) 1 0 0 0  
b) 0 0 1 1  
c) 0 1 0 0  
d) 0 1 0 0  

**Answer** b)  

**Description**  

As we press 3, F and H will become 1 because they are the outputs of OR gates. The light green wires giving inputs to the OR gates are 1 that’s why F and H becoming 1. If F and H are 1, M and N will become 1 as they are the inputs of OR gates. K and L will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 0 1 1, which is the binary equivalent of 3.

What will be the binary output, when we press 4 on the keyboard?  

a) 1 0 0 0  
b) 0 0 0 1  
c) 0 1 0 0  
d) 0 1 0 0  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

As we press 4, C will become 1 because it is the output of an OR gate. The blue wire giving input to the OR gate is 1 that’s why C is becoming 1. If C is 1, L will be 1, as it is the output of an OR gate. K, M and N will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 1 0 0, which is the binary equivalent of 4.

What will be the binary output, when we press 5 on the keyboard?  

a) 0 1 0 1  
b) 0 0 1 1  
c) 0 1 0 0  
d) 1 1 0 0  

**Answer** a)  

**Description**  

As we press 5, C and H will become 1 because they are the outputs of OR gates. The maroon wires giving inputs to the OR gates are 1 that’s why C and H becoming 1. If C and H are 1, L and N will become 1 as they are the inputs of OR gates. K and M will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 1 0 1, which is the binary equivalent of 5.

What will be the binary output, when we press 6 on the keyboard?  

a) 0 1 0 1  
b) 0 0 1 1  
c) 0 1 1 0  
d) 1 1 0 0  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

As we press 6, D and E will become 1 because they are the outputs of OR gates. The green wires giving inputs to the OR gates are 1 that’s why D and E becoming 1. If D and E are 1, L and M will become 1 as they are the inputs of OR gates. K and N will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 1 1 0, which is the binary equivalent of 6.

What will be the binary output, when we press 7 on the keyboard?  

a) 0 1 0 1  
b) 0 0 1 1  
c) 0 1 1 1  
d) 1 1 0 0  

**Answer** c)  

**Description**  

As we press 7, D, E and G will become 1 because they are the outputs of OR gates. The purple wires giving inputs to the OR gates are 1 that’s why D, E and G becoming 1. If D, E and G are 1, L, M and N will become 1 as they are the inputs of OR gates. K will be zero as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 0 1 1 1, which is the binary equivalent of 7.

What will be the binary output, when we press 8 on the keyboard?  

a) 1 0 0 0  
b) 0 0 0 1  
c) 0 1 0 0  
d) 0 1 0 0  

**Answer** a)  

**Description**  

As we press 1, A will become 1 because it is the output of an OR gate. The magenta wire giving input to the OR gate is 1 that’s why A is becoming 1. If A is 1, K will be 1, as it is the output of an OR gate. L, M and N will be zeros as they have no inputs. So the final output will be 1 0 0 0, which is the binary equivalent of 8.
